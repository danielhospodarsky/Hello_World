# Hello_World

My name is Daniel Hospodarsky and I am from Highwood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. I am currenlty a junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Sports and Recreation Management. One job that I hope to get in the future is to work in Sports Analytics for an NBA team because I enjoy to watch and play the sport of basketball.
