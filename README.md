# Project Title
**Hello World**

# Description
This project is to learn the basic understanding of GitHub. 

# About Me
My name is Daniel Hospodarsky and I am from Highwood, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. I am currently a junior at the University of Iowa majoring in Business Analytics and Information Systems with a minor in Sports and Recreation Management. One job that I hope to get in the future is to work in Sports Analytics for an NBA team because I enjoy to watch and play the sport of basketball.
